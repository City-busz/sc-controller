## Packages

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/sc-controller.svg?exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/sc-controller/versions)

Linux:
  - **Arch Linux:** Found in official [extra](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/sc-controller/) repository and [AUR/sc-controller-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sc-controller-git/)
  - **Ubuntu (24.04-noble, 26.04-resolute):** Packaged as AppImage in [GitHub releases](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases), ***which may also run fine on other operating systems - noble image is currently the most compatible one***
  - **Gentoo:** Packaged as [game-util/sc-controller](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-util/sc-controller)
  - **Void Linux:** Packaged as [sc-controller](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/sc-controller/template) - Run `xbps-install -S sc-controller` in a terminal, points to archived Ryochan7's fork at the time of writing
  - **Others:** You can attempt to use one of the AppImages (try all, AppImages built on older distributions tend to work better), or a package meant for your parent distribution if applicable. Flatpak is planned.

Windows:
  - It should be possible to get it running as per the [wiki](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/wiki/Running-SC-Controller-on-Windows), but this is untested and might be broken, report a bug if so


## Building the package by yourself

### Dependencies
  - Python 3.11+
  - GTK 3.24+
  - [PyGObject](https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject)
  - [python-gi-cairo](https://packages.debian.org/sid/python-gi-cairo) and [gir1.2-rsvg-2.0](https://packages.debian.org/sid/gir1.2-rsvg-2.0) on Debian-based distributions (included in PyGObject elsewhere)
  - [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
  - [python-evdev](https://python-evdev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [python-pylibacl](http://pylibacl.k1024.org/)
  - [python-vdf](https://pypi.org/project/vdf/)
  - [python-libusb1](https://github.com/vpelletier/python-libusb1)
  - [python-ioctl-opt](https://pypi.org/project/ioctl-opt/)
  - [gtk-layer-shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk-layer-shell)

### Via Python into a local build directory
  - ~~Download and extract [latest release](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases/latest)~~ .zip releases without .git directory are currently broken - tracked in [#50](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/issues/50)
  - Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller.git` and navigate into it: `cd sc-controller`
  - `python3 -m build --wheel`
  - `python3 -m installer --destdir="./build" dist/*.whl`
  - Run the app via: `SCC_SHARED="${PWD}" PYTHONPATH="./build/usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages" PATH="${PWD}/build/usr/bin:${PATH}" ./build/usr/bin/sc-controller`

### Via Docker
A test build with Docker can be created using the following way:

```bash
docker build -o build-output --build-arg BASE_CODENAME=noble .
```

### Via Python venv through run.sh
  - ~~Download and extract [latest release](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases/latest)~~ .zip releases without .git directory are currently broken - tracked in [#50](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/issues/50)
  - Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller.git` and navigate into it: `cd sc-controller`
  - Optionally checkout a branch or a tag, like `python3`(default) or `v0.4.9.8.8`
  - Execute `./run.sh`, this automatically builds the project into a venv called `.env`, activates it and runs sc-controller, which in turn runs scc-daemon if one does not run already
  - If you are debugging an issue, running `./run.sh daemon` first will launch the daemon in debug mode, allowing you to launch sc-controller in another terminal with `./run.sh`
